## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a graphic engine (**ray casting**)
using a minimal graphic library, like it is mlx.

---

## Features

* [] Wall collisions
* [] Minimap system
* [] Open and close doors
* [] Animated sprites
* [] Rotate with mouse

---

## Compiling

To play this graphic engine, you just will execute "_make_", and it
will compile. This just works in _linux_, and _macOs_.

It needs a parameter, which is a file ending with _**.cub**_, this file
is the map we want to play. Example: cub3d map.cub
